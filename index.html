        <p><b>Sajek: </b><span>Surrounded by the hills of Mizoram on the east and Tripura on the north, Sajek Valley that once witnessed insurgencies now showcases Bangladesh's cultural diversity engaging people of <img src="sajek.jpg" alt="" srcset="" style="height: 170px; width: 170px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"> different ethnicities in developing tourism in the area for their economic benefit and social uplifting.The river Sajek demarcates the boundary between Bangladesh and India while the area named after it is the biggest union of the country and falls under Baghaichori upazila in Rangamati hill district.Located 95 km north of Rangamati, Sajek is only 67 km north-east of the headquarters of Khagrachhari hill district. Driving through the high peaks and falls of the road one can reach from Khagrachhari to Sajek Valley in about two to three hours. Bangladesh Army provides security escort service in the route from Baghathar to Sajek each day morning and evening. Sajek Valley comprises Ruilui Para, Hamari Para, and Konglak Para, where the Konglak Hill is the one of the main tourist attractions. The last village on the Bangladesh side is located on the Konglak Hill, which is predominantly inhabited by the Lusai people. Apart from the Lusais, Tripura, Pangkhoa, and Chakma people also live there.People started visiting Sajek in 2014, soon after the road network connected the valley with the rest of the country. The Bangladesh Army took about 10 years to complete the road that passed through steep terrains and valleys of the Kasalong range of mountains. Earlier it was one of the remotest areas of the country for its difficult steep terrains and had no mentionable economic activity, remembered Supriyo Chakma, a photojournalist who has been visiting the area for over two decades Sajek was neither known to people nor connected with Rangamati or its neighbouring Khagrachhari by road infrastructure, Supriyo said narrating stories of his experience while working with Dhaka-based national dailies since then. Residents of Rangamati town used to spend about two days to reach Ruilui, where most of the resorts have now been established in Sajek, he added."One could reach up to Old Lankar, the bordering village of Sajek after a 16-hour journey on foot and by shallow boat. Eight more hours was required from Old Lankar to reach Ruilui," Supriya narrated while describing how tourism helped change Sajek's socio-economic condition in front of his eyes in less than a decade. How flourishing is the tourism business in Sajek can be understood from the fact that the number of resorts in the area enlisted with the Cottage Owners Association of Sajek (COAS) rose to 83 last year from its initial tally of six in 2016.</span></p>
